# Convolutional Neural Network - Pneumonia Prediction Using X-Ray Images

We will be create a convolutional neural network with two convolutional layers and one fully connected layer to predict pneumonia, given a X-ray image as the input.
Start by importing the packages we will be using throughout the kernel:
In[1]: import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import random
from random import randint
from pathlib import Path
import os
