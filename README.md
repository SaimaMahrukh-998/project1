# Convolutional Neural Network - Pneumonia Prediction Using X-Ray Images


We will be create a convolutional neural network with two convolutional layers and one fully connected layer to predict pneumonia, given a X-ray image as the input. The dataset has been split into 'train' and 'test'' folders. Additionally, the images within these folders have been split into 'NORMAL' and 'PNEUMONIA' subfolders.
